# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for AI WONDERLAND, from initial code consolidation to public launch.

---

### **Phase 1: Consolidate Codebase** (Immediate Priority)

The project's code is currently spread across several repositories. The most important next step is to merge them into a single, main repository to streamline development.

-   [ ] **Action:** Merge `AI-WONDER-LABs/AI-WONDERLAND-INNOVATION-` (backend) and `AI-WONDER-LABs/frontend-builder` (frontend) into `wonderingtribe/AI-WONDERLAND.MAIN.REPO2`.
-   **Goal:** Have one single repository (`AI-WONDERLAND.MAIN.REPO2`) that contains all application code in an organized structure (e.g., `frontend/` and `backend/` directories).

---

### **Phase 2: Build the Core Application (MVP)**

Once the code is in one place, the next step is to integrate the components and build the core features.

-   [ ] **Action:**
    -   Connect the frontend UI to the backend AI logic.
    -   Develop the main features of the AI website/app builder.
    -   Implement user authentication (signup, login).
-   **Goal:** A functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) where a user can sign up, create a basic project, and see it work.

---

### **Phase 3: Develop the "Investors Page" Feature**

This phase focuses on building the marketplace feature for project investment.

-   [ ] **Action:** Begin working on the tasks outlined in issue **[#1: Feature: Create Investors Page for Project Investment](https://github.com/wonderingtribe/AI-WONDERLAND.MAIN.REPO2/issues/1)**.
-   **Goal:** A fully functional marketplace for investors, including project listings, creator profiles with social links, and a secure way to handle investments.

---

### **Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance**

Before going live, the platform must be thoroughly tested to ensure stability and reliability.

-   [ ] **Action:**
    -   Test the user signup and login process.
    -   Test the website/app builder from start to finish.
    -   Test the new Investors Page and the entire investment workflow.
    -   Find and fix all major bugs.
-   **Goal:** A stable, reliable, and bug-free application ready for users.

---

### **Phase 5: Publish and Launch**

Once all development and testing are complete, the project will be ready to go live.

-   [ ] **Action:**
    -   Deploy the application to a production web hosting service.
    -   Configure the domain and necessary DNS records.
    -   Announce the launch to the public.
-   **Goal:** A publicly accessible and operational platform.
